# Darryl's CardScanner
This script is quite basic and may need further optimization for efficiency and accuracy, especially in handling large files or different file formats. Also, running this script on a system could consume significant resources, depending on the amount of data to be scanned.

# Considerations
* **Privacy and Security**: Scanning for credit card data can have legal and privacy implications. Ensure you have the proper authorization and comply with relevant laws and regulations.  
* **Performance**: This script may take a significant amount of time and resources to run, especially on large file systems.  
* **False Positives/Negatives**: The script uses basic pattern matching which might not be accurate for all cases. It may produce false positives or miss some valid card numbers.  
* **File Types**: This script is basic and reads files as plain text. It doesn't handle binary files or specific formats like PDFs or Word documents.

You should test this script thoroughly in a controlled environment before considering using it in a production scenario.
