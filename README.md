# Darryl's CardScanner
This script is **quite basic** and may need further optimization for efficiency and accuracy, especially in handling large files or different file formats. Also, running this script on a system could consume significant resources, depending on the amount of data to be scanned.

# Limitations
* The script only manages plain text files, and not `.docx`, `.pdf`, or `.rtf` document files or `databases`, and other more capable (and probably costly) tools would be required for this.  
ðŸ§  While it's possible to impliment the parsing of .docx using a library like docx, .pdf using a library like PyPDF2, or .rtf using a library like rtf_to_text files, it would come at the cost of chunking files which are not possible easily with these files types. This script is optomized for low memory usage to reduce the impact to systems.

# Goals
The goal of this scanner is to help conform to:

## PCI DSS 3.2.1 control 3.2.1
which states "For a sample of system components, examine data sources including but not limited to the following, and verify that the full contents of any track from the magnetic stripe on the back of card or equivalent data on a chip are not stored after authorization:  
â€¢ Incoming transaction data  
â€¢ All logs (for example, transaction, history, debugging, error)  
â€¢ History files  
â€¢ Trace files  
â€¢ Several database schemas  
â€¢ Database contents."

## PCI DSS 3.2.1 control A3.2.5 
which states "Implement a data-discovery methodology to confirm PCI DSS scope and to locate all sources and locations of clear-text PAN at least quarterly and upon significant changes to the cardholder environment or processes.
Data-discovery methodology must take into consideration the potential for clear-text PAN to reside on systems and networks outside of the currently defined CDE."

# Considerations
* **Privacy and Security**: Scanning for credit card data can have legal and privacy implications. Ensure you have the proper authorization and comply with relevant laws and regulations.  
* **Performance**: This script may take a significant amount of time and resources to run, especially on large file systems.  
* **False Positives/Negatives**: The script uses basic pattern matching which might not be accurate for all cases. It may produce false positives or miss some valid card numbers.  
* **File Types**: This script is basic and reads files as plain text. It doesn't handle binary files or specific formats like PDFs or Word documents.

You should test this script thoroughly in a controlled environment before considering using it in a production scenario.

# Usage
`python3 darryls_cardscan.py`

# Tuning
## False Positive Credit Card Numbers
Inside the `is_luhn_valid` function, you can modify the `false_positive_numbers` variable of known false postive credit card numbers. (Default: '0000000000000000', '00000000000000', '000000000000000000')

## Ignored file types
Just above the `scan_file` function, you can modify the `ignored_extensions` variable of ignored file types (Default: '.pdf', '.docx', '.bin', '.exe', '.dll', '.zip', '.rar', '.gz')

## Ignored directories
Inside the `scan_directory` you can modify the `ignored_directories` variable (Default: '/proc', '/sys', '/dev', '/var/log/journal', '/boot', '/tmp', '/var/tmp', '/lost+found', '/mnt', '/media', '/usr', '/bin', '/sbin', '/lib', '/lib64')

# Known issues

## Memory Consumption with Large Files
The script may consume a significant amount of memory when processing large files. If the script terminates unexpectedly and you see a `Killed` message at the end of the run, this may indicate that the system ran out of memory.

To confirm this, you can check the system logs for out-of-memory (OOM) messages. Here are examples of what these messages might look like in your logs:
```
/var/log/syslog:Dec 19 11:14:37 ubuntu-20-04LTS kernel: [5254542.740910] Out of memory: Killed process 2190495 (python3) total-vm:674264kB, anon-rss:302008kB, file-rss:2320kB, shmem-rss:0kB, UID:1000 pgtables:664kB oom_score_adj:0
/var/log/syslog:Dec 19 11:14:37 ubuntu-20-04LTS kernel: [5254542.749772] oom_reaper: reaped process 2190495 (python3), now anon-rss:0kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB
```
If you encounter this issue, consider:  
1. Running the script on a system with more available memory.  
2. Adding `-chunk` to the command line.  
   Do note that this will lower accuracy because reading in 1MB chunks can split a credit card number across two chunks. This may also increase the time it takes to run.
