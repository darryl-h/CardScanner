# CardScanner
This is a simple Python script that implements the Luhn algorithm to check whether a given credit card number is valid. The Luhn algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, most notably credit card numbers.
